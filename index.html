          <p>I am currently a junior majoring in Computer Science at the University of Indianapolis, where Iâ€™ve been developing a strong foundation in software development, problem-solving, and systems thinking. Throughout my academic journey, Iâ€™ve discovered a growing interest in cybersecurity, particularly in understanding how to build secure systems and protect data in an increasingly connected world.</p>
          <p>Alongside my studies in cybersecurity, I have been exploring both front-end and back-end web development. I enjoy the creative aspect of designing intuitive user interfaces, as well as the logical structure and problem-solving involved in server-side development. Iâ€™m currently working on expanding my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, while also learning frameworks and tools that are widely used in the industry.</p>
          <p>Iâ€™m actively seeking opportunities where I can apply what Iâ€™ve learned, gain hands-on experience, and continue growing as a developer with a focus on secure, well-designed applications. I'm excited to contribute to a team, learn from professionals in the field, and bring my passion for technology into real-world projects.</p>

          <p class="headline">Coin Sorter</p>
          <p>For an engineeering course project, I coded a coin sorter application that simulates the detection, classification, and counting of coins based on user input or sensor-based data. The program was developed using C++ and implements core programming concepts such as conditional logic, data structures, loops, and object-oriented design.</p>
          <p>The coin sorter takes input values representing different coin sizes or weights and accurately sorts them into categories (e.g., pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters). It also maintains a real-time count and total monetary value. This project strengthened my problem-solving skills and gave me hands-on experience in building practical tools that combine both logical structuring and real-world applications, such as currency handling and automation.</p>
          <p>In addition, the project laid the groundwork for potential hardware integration using microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino or Raspberry Pi) to create a physical coin sorter in the future.</p>

          <p class="headline">Custom Data Compression Tool</p>
          <p>I developed a custom data compression tool using C++, focusing on efficient storage and transmission of large text files. The program implements a basic compression algorithm inspired by Huffman coding, which reduces file size by encoding frequently used characters with shorter binary representations.</p>
          <p>This project challenged me to apply advanced C++ concepts such as dynamic memory management, file I/O operations, bit manipulation, and the use of data structures like trees, maps, and priority queues. The tool includes both compression and decompression functionalities, allowing users to restore original files with accuracy.</p>
          <p>Through this project, I gained deeper insight into algorithm design, performance optimization, and real-world applications of data encoding. It also reinforced my ability to write clean, modular code and handle complex logic systematically.</p>
