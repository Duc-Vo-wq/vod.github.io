          <p>I am currently a junior majoring in Computer Science at the University of Indianapolis, where Iâ€™ve been developing a strong foundation in software development, problem-solving, and systems thinking. Throughout my academic journey, Iâ€™ve discovered a growing interest in cybersecurity, particularly in understanding how to build secure systems and protect data in an increasingly connected world.</p>
          <p>Alongside my studies in cybersecurity, I have been exploring both front-end and back-end web development. I enjoy the creative aspect of designing intuitive user interfaces, as well as the logical structure and problem-solving involved in server-side development. Iâ€™m currently working on expanding my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, while also learning frameworks and tools that are widely used in the industry.</p>
          <p>Iâ€™m actively seeking opportunities where I can apply what Iâ€™ve learned, gain hands-on experience, and continue growing as a developer with a focus on secure, well-designed applications. I'm excited to contribute to a team, learn from professionals in the field, and bring my passion for technology into real-world projects.</p>
